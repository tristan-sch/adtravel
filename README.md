## About

I redesigned the webiste from the Travel Agency [AD Travel](http://adtravel.is/) using **Wordpress** and **Next.js**

- Everything is connected to a **Wordpress** Dashboard
- I created queries with the **GraphQL API for WordPress**
- I deployed the App on **Vercel**

## Work in progress

- I wanted to build a **Trip Builder** as well but I ran out of time.
- I also still need to:
  - finish some queries
  - improve the scss
  - slider for the team members
  - finish the responsive design (only 2 breakpoints for now)

## Running the site

Add a .env.local file at the root of the project:

```
WORDPRESS_API_URL=YOUR GRAPHQL ENDPOINT
```

```
yarn install
yarn next dev
```

## Stack
